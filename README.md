### 📈 Dashboards

This project delivers two high-impact Power BI dashboards engineered to accelerate decision-making across customer analytics and credit risk assessment. These visuals translate raw data into executive-ready insights, enabling quick navigation of KPIs, behavior patterns, spend trends, product performance, and credit utilization metrics.


#### Credit Card Transaction Dashboard:
Delivers a high-fidelity view of cardholder spending patterns, transaction frequency, merchant category behavior, credit utilization trends, and risk indicators. The dashboard integrates KPI cards, slicers, drill-downs, and performance metrics to support data-driven decision-making across fraud monitoring, credit operations, and customer analytics.
